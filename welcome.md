## edit

i know that there were no new posts as promised a while back.
great deal of time was spent on researching about cms[^2] and how should the content of my blog and soon to come logs should be managed so that the site sails without much intervention. i figured using github itself to host (in a separate repository) would be the way for now. now that it's in place expect something soon.

> if you have any suggestions give me a ping

## what is this?

every silent person has a loud mind. this is my loud mind. i write about things are interesting to me and hope would be useful to somebody someday.

> disclaimer: i'm not a professional writer. just a person who likes to think. hope you don't get drowned.

## why now?

i've been logging for a long time now. been using notion[^1] and trying all kinds of software to collect my thoughts and stuff but the end goal was accessibility, always. i waited for a perfect moment to transition my baby portfolio site to a junk site that makes me proud. well... that didn't go well. i've been putting it off for a long time now. hence now tired of waiting. let's start having fun.

> warning: highly experimental content ahead. i'm not responsible for any damage caused by reading this blog. you have been warned.

[^1]: [notion](https://www.notion.so/) is made by a bunch of really cool people. it's a project organizer and note manager, it's not exactly my cup of tea but i've been using it for a while now cause didn't have anything better that suited my needs.

[^2] : cms is short for content management system, which is a fancy term used in web and apps to suggest the way the data that is changing and being collected is stored and used in a reliable non-intrusive way with additional quality of life improvements.
