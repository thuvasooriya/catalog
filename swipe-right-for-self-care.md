## what is this?

this is the third speech i had to prepare and present in my department as part of a module that is supposed to enhance your communication skills. this speech was prepared with an emphasis on presenting with the slides while covering the other important aspects of speaking as well. i hope you enjoy it.

## script

**who here has watched the _first iphone launch_?** you **must** remember the reaction of the crowd when **`steve jobs` swiped** right on the **screen** to get to the next page? it felt just like magic! now after nearly a decade, anyone who watched the google i/o 23? **(slide 1)** on the stage `pichchai` swiped and adjusted a person in a photograph so that she could hold the waterfall just right. you should’ve seen the reaction of the crowd. the details were there just like magic.

greetings to respected evaluators and fellow friends. **if i say that the digital progress that’s going to follow** this level up is going to be mind bending, would you object to it? to survive and contribute to this godspeed trip you are going to need some fancy tricks up your sleeve. let me briefly try to spark a few things i’ve learned along the way about mental health so that you can prevent meta mark, or some chinese ticks from climbing up to your top shelf.

**the convenience and benefits offered by the digital age is so bright** that we fail to see the dark places beneath. **( 1.05 slide 2)** take your friendly neighborhood advisor gpt for example, it is no miracle that it obliterated the records of other social media platforms in adoption rate! people love convenience and it’s natural, but not realizing the cost of that convenience is what results in addiction. **( 1.30 slide 3)** social platforms are deemed indispensable forms of communication and rightfully so. without them you can’t spy on your crush or say hi to your to be fiance. or call your mom every night when you study far away from home. i haven't actually done any of these things and i’m not proud of it.

**the biggest flaw of the digital age** is integrity and authenticity, with the boom of generative content and the preference to decentralized networks this has become even more difficult to regulate. **so, we should engage the digital paradigm** with mindfulness and awareness **since it’s easy to get lost in the billion dollar** enchantments that companies use, or the cheap but effective photo filters of your girlfriends list, or the too good to be true investing solutions presented by social engineers with ill intentions. i’ve been through all this and i’m not proud of this either.

in most of the apps a standard swipe brings our profile, it’s time for us to swipe right and make a self evaluation. there might be 100 solutions out there that promise you to fix your addiction to social media and detox you from digital. **but our solution comes from** what is important to us and where we are which is also known as mindfullness. people trick you to do the thing they want all the time you can trick yourself to do the right thing. i made myself practice meditation for the sake of this speech. so, i am technically a prop today. my screen time hasn’t gone down, because i’m an entc undergraduate. but i’m glad i was able to replace my anime reaction watch time with something else relatively useful.

for most guys, life is what happens between social media scrolls and self-doubt. don’t be that guy and be mindful enough to not start a relationship with a russian chat bot sent to seduce you.

**( 3.45 slide 4)**

almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you.
so, who's up for a 30 day mindfulness challenge.
