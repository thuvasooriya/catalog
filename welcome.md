## update!

i know i haven't been writing as i promised. or not publishing to be exact. bcs i'm writing stuff just not putting them up yet.
i've been researching about cms and how should i host my stuff so that i can easily update the site with what i'm writing without much intervention. so hopefully it'll be worth the wait.

> if you have any suggestions give me a ping

## what is this?

every silent person has a loud mind. this is my loud mind. i write about things that i find interesting and hope would be useful to somebody someday. no, that last part was a lie, i write about stuff that excites me only sorry ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

> desclaimer: i'm not a professional writer. i'm just a person who likes to think. i hope you don't get drowned.

## why now?

i've been logging for a long time now. i've been using notion[^1] and trying all kinds of software to collect my thoughts and stuff but the end goal was accessibility, always. i waited for a perfect moment to transition my baby portfolio site to a junk site that i'm proud of. well i don't want to waste any more of my time trying to design the best portfolio ever. i've been putting it off for a long time now. but i'm tired of waiting. so here i am. logging. copying. publishing. for me. for us.

[^1]: [notion](https://www.notion.so/) is made by a bunch of really cool people. it's a project organizer and note manager, it's not exactly my cup of tea but i've been using it for a while now cause i didn't have anything better that suited my needs.
