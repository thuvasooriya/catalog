## what is this?

this is the first speech i had to prepare and present in my department as part of a module that is supposed to enhance your communication skills. this speech focuses on a single aspect that i don't remember anymore, maybe i'll look into it later. one thing i remember is i mistook when i had to present this speech and didn't prepare it on the day i was supposed to present it. so i had to remember the script within the lunch break and present with my usual not so official attire. the madam wasn't pleased with the attire or the topic. i mean who don't like food right? anyways i hope you enjoy it.

## script

good morning!,
hope everyone had your breakfast. or i think you shouldn't have. depending on your taste, you might get hungry or feel disgusted. yes, today, i want to share something about the future of food. we are facing a lot of challenges as a human species such as climate change, population growth, and food insecurity, etc. and these have lead to some interesting and strange developments. to honor the time and everyone's wellbeing, i'll be brief and share three such developments regarding the future of food.

the first one is a good news for some vegans, depending on how you classify being a vegan. it's about the plant-based meat and cultured meat. companies such as beyond meat and impossible foods produce meat alternatives that taste and look like real meat, but are made from plant-based ingredients. these are supposedly more sustainable and healthier than conventional meat, since they require fewer resources to produce and contain no cholesterol or animal fat. burger king and kfc, are already offering plant-based options on their menus. so when you see it, give these alternatives a try - you might just convert! and then there is cultured meat, also known as lab-grown meat or cell-based meat. this has the potential to reduce the environmental impact and animal suffering from meat production, while still providing the taste and nutritional benefits of conventional meat. a company called memphis meats, has developed lab-grown meatballs, chicken, and duck. so, next time you're at a fancy restaurant and the waiter asks if you'd like the kobe beef or something, just ask if they have any cultured stuff - you'll be cutting-edge and compassionate at the same time!

secondly, what do you think are considered a sustainable and nutritious food source for the future? bugs are the new beef! insects require less land and water to produce and are high in protein and micronutrients. they're already a delicacy in many countries, and some companies are developing insect-based products such as protein bars and snacks. as a matter of fact, the startup bitty foods, and finnish company entis are already making cricket flour, which can be used to make cookies, chips, and even protein bars. so, next time you see a cricket jumping around, don't squish it, just add it to your protein shake! - don't think about it and you know what a cricket is right.

for the final one i picked something delicate, it's about printers, 3d printers. yes, that's right, you can now print your food like you print your documents! this could potentially revolutionize the food industry by allowing for personalized and on-demand food production. the company natural machines makes a 3d food printer called the foodini. the foodini can print customized pizzas, burgers, and even pancakes. so the next time mom asks you to peel onions just hit ctrl + p.

so, the future of food is not just about sustainability, nutrition and stuff, it's also about having fun and being creative with our lives. so, the next time someone asks you what's for dinner, just say, "i don't know, let's ask gpt and hit print" or, if you're feeling adventurous, why not throw a cricket party and serve up some delicious snacks? the possibilities are endless and exciting, so let's embrace the future of food with open minds and empty stomachs. thank you for listening and bon app√©tit!
